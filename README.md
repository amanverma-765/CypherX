## Functional Requirements

- [x] **Add Password**: Users can securely add new passwords by providing details such as the account type (e.g., Gmail, Facebook, Instagram), username/email, and password.
- [x] **View/Edit Password**: Users can view and edit existing passwords, including account details like username/email and password.
- [x] **Show List of Passwords on Home Screen**: The home screen of the application displays a list of all saved passwords, showing essential details for each entry.
- [x] **Delete Password**: Users can delete passwords.

## Technical Requirements 

- [x] **Encryption**: Implement strong encryption algorithms (e.g., AES, RSA) to secure password data.
- [x] **Database**: Use a secure database (e.g., SQLite, Room) to manage encrypted passwords locally on the device.
- [x] **User Interface**: Design a clean and intuitive user interface for managing passwords.
- [x] **Input Validation**: Implement validation to ensure that mandatory fields are not empty.
- [x] **Error Handling**: Properly handle errors and edge cases to ensure a smooth user experience.

## Bonus Features (Optional)

- [x] **Security Feature**: When the user opens the app, prompt them to authenticate using biometric (e.g., fingerprint, face ID) or a PIN screen for added security.
- [x] **Password Strength Meter**: Provide a visual indicator of password strength to help users create strong passwords.
- [x] **Password Generation**: Provide a feature to generate strong, random passwords for new accounts.

## Tech Stack Used

- Minimum SDK level 24.
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) based, utilizing [Coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines) + [Flow](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/) for asynchronous operations.
- Jetpack Libraries:
  - Jetpack Compose: Androidâ€™s modern toolkit for declarative UI development.
  - Lifecycle: Observes Android lifecycles and manages UI states upon lifecycle changes.
  - ViewModel: Manages UI-related data and is lifecycle-aware, ensuring data survival through configuration changes.
  - [Koin](https://insert-koin.io/): Facilitates dependency injection.
- Architecture:
  - MVI Architecture (Model - View - Intent): Facilitates separation of concerns and promotes maintainability.
  - Repository Pattern: Acts as a mediator between different data sources and the application's business logic.
- [Kotlinx-Serialization](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization): A modern JSON parsing library.
- [Voyager](https://voyager.adriel.cafe/): A modern and robust navigation library.
- Room-DB: Persistence library in Android Jetpack that simplifies the process of working with SQLite databases. 
- [Coil](https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/): An image loading library for Android backed by Kotlin Coroutines.
- [Jsoup](https://jsoup.org/): Java library that simplifies working with real-world HTML and XML.
